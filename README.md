### What is this?
This panel offers a quick overview of installed applications, information about their status and information about the server in general. It is written in Python 3 and based on the Flask web server. Its main goals are to be performant, quick and easier to customize than the previous incarnation which was based on the quickbox_dashboard and based on PHP.

### Quick Start:

This package is included in the swizzin repository of applications. To easily install it, you simply need to use box:

```
sudo box install panel
```

If you are adapting this package to work outside of a swizzin environment, the steps necessary for install are outlined in [setup.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liaralabs/swizzin_dashboard/master/setup.sh)

#### Dependencies

- Python 3.6+
- Flask
- Flask-htpasswd
- Flask-SocketIO
- eventlet
